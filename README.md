# ROM Loader for IOT RetroPie

## How to use

Run the client on the machine which contains the roms that you would like to load onto the machine running RetroPie. It will ask what directory you would
like to sync to the RetroPie, and then will take those roms and transfer them across the network to the pi. You should also have functionality to ping
the server with a "view" request and it will show you which roms it has on it for which systems.

Load the server onto the machine which is running RetroPie and have the server begin running on the machine's start up. It will open up a port on the 
network in which rom transfers can take place. You may also ping the server with a "view" request and it will show you which roms are present on it for 
which systems.
